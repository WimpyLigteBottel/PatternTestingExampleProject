### PatternTestingExampleProject
The goal of the project is use as many patterns as possible and define reason on why One would use them



### **Singleton pattern**
````
For the singleton pattern you only want one instance of a variable because, it might be
very expensive to construct it. 


If you have a look at my PrimeCalculator it construct an model with primenumbers up to the amount specified and you can then
quickly retrieve the primenumber you are looking for (ignore spot zero in list)
````
### **Factory pattern**
